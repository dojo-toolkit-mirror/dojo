   Would you want to type a novel inside a a box the size of a postage
   stamp?&nbsp; No, no one in their right mind would want to do that!&nbsp; So
   why is it that so many sites, such as blogs, forums, and web-based e-mail
   programs only provide users a tiny input window?
</p>
<p>
   Small edit windows are extremely difficult to use well and seem ridiculous
   when there is plenty of remaining space in the browser window taken up by
   menus, banners, side bars, advertisements, and so on.&nbsp; All that space
   could, and should, be used to provide users a better experience when they're
   typing up text.&nbsp; Easier said than done, unfortunately.

   The dojo community realized that wouldn't it be great if you could, with the
   click of a button, pop your edit window to the full browser window, then with
   another click, reduce it back? With that thought in mind, the <span
   style="font-weight: bold;">Full Screen</span> plugin was born.&nbsp; With
   this plugin enabled in the editor, a single click of the mouse (or the key
   command of CTRL-SHIFT-F11) will instruct the Editor to take over the entire
   view port.&nbsp; When the users are done editing, another click puts it right
   back to where it was and in its original size.

   <div style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); font-size: 1.5em;">
      Try it out!
   </div>
   <p>
      In the dijitEditor view, click the
      <img alt="Full Screen Icon" src="./editorDemoImages/fullscreen.jpg">
      full screen icon.&nbsp; The editor will take over your entire
      browser.&nbsp; Clicking it again will restore the editor's original
      state.&nbsp; Simple, yet incredibly powerful.&nbsp; The age if
      postage-stamp sized editing boxes is <span style="font-style: italic;
      font-weight: bold;">over</span>.
