   The graphics of the dijit.Editor, while functional, looked dated and not as professional
   as the Dojo development community would like. One of the major initiatives
   of the Dojo Toolkit 1.4 was to polish the rough edges of Dojo and really make it
   look first class. So naturally the Editor icons were looked at and completely revamped!
   With the help of several of our corporate citizens, we reworked the basic icon set
   into cleaner, more explanatory, images for all the default actions and even some
   new ones. The end result was a much more professional look to our editor.
    We're pleased with the results and I think you will be too. Just
   look below to see a small example of the transformation!

   looked better</span>!

   And of course if the icon styles do not fit your application, the Editor can be re-skinned
   to icons of your choosing. Take a look at one of the theme files, such as <i>dijit/themes/tundra/editor.css</i>
   for examples on how to define styles to replace the editor icons with ones of your
   choosing.
