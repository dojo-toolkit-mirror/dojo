   The Editor has always had a pair of dialogs that let you insert or edit links
   or images.&nbsp; They worked okay, but the dojo community believes things can
   always be improved, so the LinkDialog was revamped for the Dojo toolkit,
   version 1.4!

      Hyperlinks

   </div>
   Hyperlink editing now allows you to specify the target window that the linked
   document is opened in.&nbsp; this means users of the rich text editor can
   specify to open up the document in the current window when a user clicks on,
   to spawning a new window when the user clicks on it.&nbsp; Setting the
   behavior is as simple as selecting the desired target from a drop down. In
   addition, a double-click will open up the link editing dialog for you.&nbsp;
   This makes it quick and convenient to edit links!

      Images

   </div>
   The image dialog templates were redone to be cleaner and handle alt text
   better.&nbsp; In addition, a single click on an image will select it, and a
   double-click will open up the image editing dialog for you.&nbsp; This is far
   simpler than the old way of having to drag-select the image, and only the
   image, then manually opening the image dialog through the drop-down
   button.&nbsp;

      Improvements to validation
   </div>
   The validators that look at the target urls for images and documents have
   been enhanced.&nbsp; If it has not been provided and the validator detects
   the location looks like 'hostname/something', then the editor will
   automatically prepend &quot;http://&quot; to your url for you.&nbsp; What if
   you still want to use relative urls?&nbsp; Well, you still can!&nbsp; Just be
   sure to start them with ./, and the validator will not prepend to your url.
