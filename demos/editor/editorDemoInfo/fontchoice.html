   The FontChoice plugin actually provides three drop downs to the Editor.&nbsp;
   These drop downs provide features such as selection of a font face,
   definition of a font size, and defining a type of block formatting to apply
   to selected text.&nbsp; In versions of dojo prior to 1.4, these worked, but
   they behaved differently in different web browsers.&nbsp; Not only that, but
   they didn't wrap well if the editor toolbar wrapped.&nbsp;

<p>
   Well, all that has been fixed as of the Dojo toolkit, version 1.4.&nbsp; The
   internals of the FontChoice plugin have been reworked and extensive testing
   performed, both manually and through the development of comprehensive
   automated unit tests, to ensure that they operate consistently on <i>all</i>
   browsers supported by the Dojo Toolkit.&nbsp; Not only that, but even the
   minor complaints were corrected.&nbsp; They now wrap far more cleanly.&nbsp;
   And another feature that was added due to requests by many of our users, the
   plugins now allow users to specify how the drop downs display the
   options.&nbsp; There are two modes, the default mode is preview mode.&nbsp;
   This means the options are displayed in a way that demonstrates what the
   option will look like when applied to the selected text.&nbsp; Or, if the
   user prefers, the options will render in simple, plain text.&nbsp;

   Give the reworked FontChoice plugins a try!  I think you'll like the
   improvements made in the dojo toolkit, version 1.4!
