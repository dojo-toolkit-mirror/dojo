   No matter what, there are always some people who want to work with the source
   view of a document in addition to editing it as a WSYWIG RichText
   document.&nbsp; This is common in blog environments and forums, as well as
   many intranet applications. &nbsp; Wouldn't it be great if those applications
   could use the dijit.Editor as well. So as of the Dojo Toolkit, version 1.4,
   the editor has a View Source plugin.

<p>
   Once the view source plugin is enabled, the user can click the view source icon
   <img alt="View Source Icon" src="./editorDemoImages/viewsource.jpg">
   (Or use the key command CTRL-SHIFT-F12) to toggle the view into source
   mode.&nbsp; Clicking it again (or using the key command again) returns the
   editor to WYSIWYG mode. &nbsp; With the View Source plugin, you application
   has the best of both words; a source view for users who are technical and
   like working in source, and a WYSIWYG view for those more familiar with 'word
   processor' style editing.

      Try it!
   </div>
   <p>
      Click the view source icon
      <img alt="View Source Icon" src="./editorDemoImages/viewsource.jpg">
      in the editor on the right. &nbsp; You will see the view toggle to source
      more.&nbsp; Also notice all the Rich Text editing options in the toolbar
      are automatically disabled.&nbsp; Clicking the icon again will restore
      Rich Text editing mode.
