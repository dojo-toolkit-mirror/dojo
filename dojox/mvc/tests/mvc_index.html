		<h1>Dojo MVC Patterns</h1>
		<p>
			Our earlier examples of <a href="http://doughays.dojotoolkit.org/patterns">Patterns for Enterprise RIAs</a>
			were built on the current dojo.data APIs and focused on databinding for form widgets
			and then building on that support to implement composite patterns such as Master/Detail 
			and List-to-list. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Based on <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.dojo.devel/12868">feedback</a> from the Dojo contributor community, we have reworked
			the base MVC framework to build on dojo.Stateful rather than dojo.data.  In the examples
			below we show binding to model data which is native javascript objects such as will be
			contained in the upcoming Dojo 2.0 data store -- the only assumption is that these objects
			implement dojo.Stateful so that widgets can bind to their value and other properties giving
			model metadata such as validity, relevance, R/O status etc.

		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<p>
			<dl>
				<dt><a href="test_mvc_shipto-billto-simple.html">Simple data-bound fields</a></dt>
				<dd>"Hello world" of data binding -- no hierarchical or repeating structure nor model validation...just data binding.</dd>
				<dt><a href="test_mvc_shipto-billto-hierarchical.html">Hierarchical data-bound fields</a></dt>
				<dd>Widgets are nested hierarchically showing relative binding context.</dd>
				<dt><a href="test_mvc_loan-stateful.html">Data-bound form fields</a></dt>
				<dd>Form widgets bind to model data and merge model and widget states (e.g. validity) to determine overall status.
				Data is provided for zipcodes of 10024 or 10706 to see side-effects on completing related fields.  Try other 5-digit numeric values
				to see the effect of model-flagged invalidity on the widget.  Non-numeric fields trigger widget validation
				failures and block flushing the value to the model.  Try driving housing percent above 33% to raise
				warnings on that field through its model validity as well.  Try zero'ing out all housing
				expenses to see the effect of relevance=false on the total housing field.
				</dd>
				<dt><a href="test_mvc_search-results-repeat.html">Repeating templated widget content</a></dt>
				<dd>Container "repeat" widget expands templated content and provides data binding context to child widgets.</dd>
				<dt><a href="test_mvc_search-results-ins-del.html">Repeating content with insert/delete operations</a></dt>
				<dd>Above repeat example with mutable list for insert/delete.</dd>
	
				<dt><a href="test_mvc_generate-view.html">Model-bound view generation</a></dt>
	
				<dd>Form generated based on JSON model provided in a text area and updated based on structural and value changes to the model.</dd>
