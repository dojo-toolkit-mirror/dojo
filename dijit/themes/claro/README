These are "less" files that compile into the CSS of claro.   See http://lesscss.org/
and https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/ for detailed instructions.

---------
Installing and running on Windows:

1. Install node:
    a) Go to https://github.com/ajaxorg/node-builds, press download button, and select "download zip"
    b) unzip the file into C:\

2. Install less:

	a) Go to https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/archives/master, press download button, and select "download zip"
	b) unzip the file into C:\

2. Add node and lessc to your path.

    a) open Control Panel --> click System icon --> select Advanced tab --> click Environment variables button
    b) press "edit" on path
    c) depending on what directory you unzipped to and the exact filenames, you will add something like

	;C:\ajaxorg-node-builds-0fcee7d\win32;C:\cloudhead-less.js-7fb09f\bin
	
	d) add new environment variable NODE_PATH with value like this (depending on exact download name):

		C:\cloudhead-less.js-7fb09f\lib

3. From the command prompt:

C:\> cd C:\myworkspace\dijit\themes\claro
C:\> copy C:\cloudhead-less.js-7fb09f\bin\lessc .

4. To compile a file (ex: compile Dialog.less --> Dialog.css):
C:\> node lessc Dialog.less

--------
To install/run less version 2 on mac:

1. install Node.js
	Go to http://nodejs.org/#download   (./configure, make, make install).
	Alternately download a built copy from https://github.com/ajaxorg/node-builds
2. download less from https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/archives/master
3. edit .bash_profile etc. to add node and lessc to path


To compile a single file:
  $ lessc Calendar.less Calendar.css
  
You will need to put the path to lessc depending on where you downloaded it.

To compile all the files:

  $ for file in *.less */*.less; do echo === $file; /less_dir/bin/lessc $file $(echo $file |sed s/.less/.css/); done


-------
Alternately, you can install less version 1, but I'd rather not use it for checked in files
since it breaks a part a lot of rules into multiple rules, causing spurious diffs.

To install on a mac:
  $ sudo gem install less
  
On Windows or Linux, make sure you have ruby and ruby-gems installed first.
If you need help installing ruby please check out ruby-lang.org for more details.
