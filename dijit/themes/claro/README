These are "less" files that compile into the CSS of claro.   See http://lesscss.org/
and https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/ for detailed instructions

To install less version 2:

1. install Node.js:  http://nodejs.org/#download   (./configure, make, make install)
2. download less from https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/archives/master

-----------

To compile a single file:
  $ /less_dir/bin/lessc Calendar.less Calendar.css
  
You will need to put the path to lessc depending on where you downloaded it.

To compile all the files:

  $ for file in *.less */*.less; do echo === $file; /less_dir/bin/lessc $file $(echo $file |sed s/.less/.css/); done
  
PC users will need Cygwin or some UNIX toolkit.

-------
Alternately, you can install less version 1, but I'd rather not use it for checked in files
since it breaks a part a lot of rules into multiple rules, causing spurious diffs.

To install on a mac:
  $ sudo gem install less
  
On Windows or Linux, make sure you have ruby and ruby-gems installed first.
If you need help installing ruby please check out ruby-lang.org for more details.
